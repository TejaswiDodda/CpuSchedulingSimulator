# CpuSchedulingSimulator

**CpuSchedulingSimulator** is a web-based application designed to visually demonstrate various CPU scheduling algorithms. It helps students and professionals understand how each algorithm works through interactive simulations and visual outputs.

## üß† Overview

This simulator provides implementations of several CPU scheduling techniques commonly studied in Operating Systems courses, including:

- **FCFS** (First Come First Serve)
- **SJF** (Shortest Job First)
- **SRTF** (Shortest Remaining Time First)
- **Round Robin**
- **Non-Preemptive Round Robin**
- **Priority Scheduling**
- **HRRN** (Highest Response Ratio Next)
- **LRTF** (Longest Remaining Time First)

Each scheduling algorithm is presented with its own HTML and JS files to simulate the logic and display visual output.
